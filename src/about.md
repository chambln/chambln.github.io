Colophon
--------

I wrote [a simple makefile] that generates this site using [pandoc(1)]
and [sassc(1)]. You can see all the source code and embarrassing history
in [its repository]. I then refactored it into a more generic template
which can be found [here].

The [RSS feed] is generated with the help of [Pandoc RSS], which I also
made, so there's a nontrivial chance it's not working properly.
