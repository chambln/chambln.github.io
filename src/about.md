I wrote [a simple makefile] that generates this site using [pandoc(1)]
and [sassc(1)]. It's hosted on GitHub pages because I'm cheap. You can
see all the source code and embarrassing history in [its repository]. I
then refactored it into a more generic template which can be found
[here].

Contact
=======

I will be mildly pleased to receive comments in the general direction of
my email, `chambln@protonmail.com`. You can also find me on [GitHub]. I
am [\@chambln] on Twitter, but I'm not active there.

Here is my [PGP public key].
